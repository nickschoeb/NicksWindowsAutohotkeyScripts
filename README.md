My AutoHotkey scripts for Windows

* Get the AutoHotkey software at https://autohotkey.com/
* Last tested against AutoHotkey version 1.1.26.01 on Windows 10 @ 2017-10-26 @ 2145

* Scripts
  - CapsLockwasdArrows.ahk
    - What it does:   This disables your caps lock key and [caps lock + { W, A, S, D }] become arrow keys
    - Why?:           I like this method of navigation in text editors sometimes and I dislike the caps lock key
  - CapsLockVimArrows.ahk
    - What it does:   This disables your caps lock key and [caps lock + { H, J, K, L }] become Vim arrow keys
    - Why?:           I am getting into Vim again
